## Project overview
Systems B228 and B335 haven been subjects systematically for decades now. Interest is born from the mass ejection that have been detected from them suggesting the formation of an accretion disk surrounding a relative low mass center.
These bodies are considered as Class 0 protostellar systems based on the presence of line spectra in band 5 and 9 related to blue shifted emission in an inward fashion to geometric center. 

Continuum spectrum data from recent ALMA's observation is being analyzed through CARTA and soon using Python. 

## Project Long Term Objectives
1. **Find evidence of mass loss due to winds, atomic jets and molecular outflows in two protostellar systems of Class 0.**
2. **Establish a premise of how frequent the phenomenon is amongst similar star-forming systems.**
3. **Visually represent the data from ALMA-telescope as a proof of a significant material ejection in B228 and B335.**

### Learning objectives
1. **Achieve a wide understanding of the dynamics of forming stars, the conditions behind their behaviour and the physical principles implied in these processes.**
2. **Develope maturity in programming dealing with data cubes and experimental observations from Astro-chemistry.**
3. **Gain experience at manipulating astronomical tools for experimental data analysis.**
4. **Expand my current knowledge in radiations and classical mechanics by projecting these theories in schemes outside of condensed matter and theoretical physics.**

## Current state of research as of October 1st, 2023
### Searching for: 
1. *Chronological reports on low mass celestial systems where mass ejection has been suspected due to outflows or winds.*
2. *Algorithms and built-in functions in Python to analyze astronomical data enhancing precision and efficiency.*
3. *Documentation on the physical and mathematical criteria to establish a relation between star formation and molecular outflows.*
4. *Patterns that suggest a confirmation of the hypotheses presented so far in the academic literature about B228 and B335 as young celestial bodies in process of forming stars.*
