Molecular outflow from two low mass systems

Systems B228 and B335 haven been subjects systematically for decades now. Interest is born from the mass ejection that have been detected from them suggesting the formation of an accretion disk surrounding a relative low mass center.
These bodies are considered as Class 0 protostellar systems based on the presence of line spectra in band 5 and 9 related to blue shifted emission in an inward fashion to geometric center. 

Continuum spectrum data from recent ALMA's observation is being analyzed through CARTA and soon using Python.
